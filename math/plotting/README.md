# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This directory contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various data visualization techniques using Matplotlib. These examples cover fundamental plotting capabilities essential for data analysis and machine learning applications.

## Overview

The plotting exercises in this directory progress from basic to advanced visualization techniques:

- Basic plots (line, scatter)
- Scale adjustments (logarithmic scales)
- Multiple data visualization
- Statistical visualizations (histograms)
- Complex visualization layouts
- Multi-variable data representation (stacked bar charts)

## Files and Descriptions

- `0-line.py`: Creates a simple line graph of a cubic function with a red line
- `1-scatter.py`: Demonstrates scatter plotting of height vs weight data
- `2-change_scale.py`: Shows how to implement logarithmic scaling for exponential decay visualization
- `3-two.py`: Plots multiple data series (two radioactive decay curves) with custom styling
- `4-frequency.py`: Creates a histogram showing the distribution of student grades
- `5-all_in_one.py`: Demonstrates subplot arrangement by combining multiple visualization types in one figure
- `6-bars.py`: Implements a stacked bar chart showing fruit quantities by person with color coding

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Running the Examples

To run any of the examples in this directory:

```bash
# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x 0-line.py

# Run the script
./0-line.py

# Alternatively
python3 0-line.py
```
