# Linear Algebra

This directory contains a collection of Python functions implementing fundamental linear algebra operations, both using pure Python and NumPy.

## Project Overview

The project explores different aspects of linear algebra through practical implementation, starting with basic array operations and progressing to more complex matrix manipulations. The implementation is divided into two sections: pure Python operations and NumPy-based operations.

## Files and Descriptions

### Pure Python Operations

- `0-slice_me_up.py`: Demonstrates array slicing to extract specific portions of a list
- `1-trim_me_down.py`: Extracts the middle columns from a 2D matrix
- `2-size_me_please.py`: Calculates the shape (dimensions) of a matrix of any dimension
- `3-flip_me_over.py`: Transposes a 2D matrix (swaps rows and columns)
- `4-line_up.py`: Performs element-wise addition of two arrays
- `5-across_the_planes.py`: Performs element-wise addition of two 2D matrices
- `6-howdy_partner.py`: Concatenates two arrays into a single new list
- `7-gettin_cozy.py`: Concatenates two 2D matrices along a specified axis
- `8-ridin_bareback.py`: Performs matrix multiplication of two 2D matrices

### NumPy Operations

- `9-let_the_butcher_slice_it.py`: Uses NumPy slicing to extract specific portions of matrices
- `10-ill_use_my_scale.py`: Calculates the shape of a NumPy array
- `11-the_western_exchange.py`: Transposes a NumPy array
- `12-bracin_the_elements.py`: Performs element-wise operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- `13-cats_got_your_tongue.py`: Concatenates two NumPy arrays along a specified axis
- `14-saddle_up.py`: Performs matrix multiplication using NumPy's optimized functions

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- NumPy library (for tasks 9-14)

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding of array and matrix operations in Python
- Implementation of basic linear algebra concepts
- Efficient array manipulation using slicing
- Matrix operations including transposition and multiplication
- Transitioning from pure Python implementations to NumPy's vectorized operations
